welcome back to the channel ladies and gentlemen today we are making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich now hold up hold up before you click off the video you might be wondering Remington why are you showing us how to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches we've made these our entire lives we know what you got to do whoa hold your horses before you click off of the video is that a good horse impression I'll fix up we are going to be doing a twist on the classic recipe guys so I love peanut butter jelly sandwiches but honestly they're not too healthy for yet you got your traditional Jam which is loaded with sugar peanut butter which is amazing but you got to kind of limit it right bread's full of carbohydrates not a lot of fiber not a lot of nutritional value but we're going to put a slight twist on this recipe it's changing some of the ingredients around guys going for some healthier options and we're also gonna do a little bit of a peanut butter hacks then I'm telling you guys is going to make this recipe it's going to be delicious so you guys are ready to see exactly what I have in store for you another Remington in the kitchen bro cooking 101 whatever you want to call it episode then we are going to get this done guys are you ready because I know I am let's do [Music] let's go over the ingredients you need for this recipe real quick while I'm still recovering from that horse noise I made earlier I apologize for that guys I apologize so starting off in traditional peanut butter and jelly fashion we have ourselves some natural peanut butter right here fresh Jarrah figured this would be our best bet love this stuff tastes amazing instead of regular jelly guys they're going to be using Paulaner all on our polymer not sure how to pronounce that but hey you guys get the point reason sugar-free with fibre strawberry preserves now honestly this stuff to me tastes just like jelly I don't really know if jelly is a preserve or how that works but I'm telling you this stuff is great and once the macros here look at this guys no sugar in the entire thing 5 grams of carbs per serving 3 grams of fiber per sister Lee can help there are fiber up there give us not amazing flavor with all the added sugar guys is what we're trying to do limit the sugar limit the caloric impact of this recipe mmm moving into bread we are going to be choosing this healthy light 100% whole wheat high-fiber whole grain bread look at this 35 calories personalized so if you guys know how to do math boom multiply that by 2 and we have ourselves 70 calories now check out the nutrition on this bread right here in two slices there's only 1/2 gram of fat 16 grams of carbs with 5 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein so this is definitely putting our best foot forward for this recipe and then a couple wildcard ingredients hopefully I don't lose you here want to see what we do with oh I think you'll be pleasantly surprised we have some protein powder I'm not looking for vanilluxe it seems to be the most neutral of the flavors you can use but hey or anything like me I really think any flavor of protein powder would make this good but hey I'll leave that up to you guys and then we also have some Greek yogurt as well so I'm going to go ahead with all the ingredient links down in the description box below that way you guys know what you need pretty simple but I put the exact quantities and everything in this video as well as the description box so now that that's out of the way let's go ahead and make this epic protein peanut butter and jelly sandwich in order to do this protein peanut butter hack we're going to need a few key things we all need our food scale specking really the mixing bowl store if you need our natural peanut butter and we're also going to need our Greek yogurt now we have all these it's time to weigh out our so first things first we're going to go and get 32 grams or two tablespoons of our natural peanut butter and put it down here in the mixing bowl 27 and 32 right on the money you're allowed to lick the spoon by the way afterwards you don't got to count on your macros that's one of the trade secrets if anybody asks you tell them I said you're allowed to do it next up we 56 grams of a plain Greek yogurt you can use flavored Greek yogurt if you want but the planes going to have by far the best nutritional value so throw this in here 5 and boom 56 right on the money now once these are mixed in here we're going to our protein powders take one scoop and add it right in here now the goal at this point is going to be to mix these together and you'll see what happens it's not going to look very appetizing at first you probably wondering what's happening but trust me the finished product you guys will totally understand and check it out guys hopefully you can see this look how creamy that is literally looks just like peanut butter didn't add any water didn't do anything like that all we simply did was the Greek yogurt protein powder and we officially have our own protein peanut butter right here awesome stuff guys awesome stuff so now this point want to go ahead and put this on our first slice of bread we will go ahead with our butter nice and slowly but surely put all this clutter on here now take a look at how much more peanut butter we have since we mixed it up if you think about it one of the reasons this recipe works so well is that it really thickens up your peanut butter so you get a lot more of it if you have this exact quantity of actual real legit 100% peanut butter if you have far less protein and way more fat and way more towers do this option here thickens it up it allows us to keep the overall fat content low but still give us that nice thick creamy consistency of having a ton of peanut butter on this sandwich this is going to be great guys look at that oh and I already did a mini taste test of just this peanut butter by itself but I'm telling you it's actually really really good I keep in mind you could also buy yourself a protein peanut butter such as buck baked such as angry Mills anything like that but you're not going to quite get this level of protein here or volume using any of those other ones because what makes a peanut butter sandwich good the peanut butter of course alright there we go now on to the jelly now this is the easy part guys we only fifty-one grams or three tablespoons of this sugar-free jelly preserves so we'll go down in here slowly but surely pull it out and place it on the other slice of bread I'm really excited to try this guys I haven't had a PB&J and boy the longest time peanut butter and jelly goes together like lamb and tuna fish because you get the movie reference comment below if not I might be a little too old for you or young hey that door swings both ways the theoretical movie door swings both ways and there we go perfect now on the most crucial component the joining oh ho ho boom there we go now let's cut this bad boy when and put out the big knife like I'm compensating for something I'm kidding not really alright let's get in here and cut this thing down the middle oh I almost had like 200 dislikes on this video you don't cut down the middle guys you go corner to corner so we're gonna straight down start sawing away at it and this is how it's done ladies and gentlemen little pro tip don't get a fleet that I was a rim edge because yeah problems you know bingo let's see how she looks oh baby would you look at that it is officially taste test time ladies and gentlemen all right guys let's see exactly how this turned out I am so excited to give this a try let's do this you guys ready three two one mmm this guy's this is really good I really if someone made this and it is me i wouldnt be resolved if ur ins we're coming though I'm a regular plain box llama so good this is so good holy crap this might actually become something that's our make it more on the regular oh yeah ball-ball yeah Wow that ladies and gentlemen give ZW little girl for sure mmm only downside to feelers you get it stuck in your teeth is it in my teeth not that horse noise again alright guys so here's the real kicker with this right the tube with the macro nutrients descendants right now in this entire sandwich there is 445 calories now in order to put that into perspective right one serving of natural peanut butter by itself is 200 calories if you went ahead right and you wanted that amount of peanut butter on a regular peanut butter and jelly sandwich you're already over two servings of peanut butter which puts you right at 400 calories and the more you go you guys can do the math gets follow that intro really quick so for 45 calories in this recipe it's not bad at all now let me go to the macro breakdown with you guys in this entire thing there was only 18 grams of fat each full serving of peanut butter has 16 grams of fat so we left that full serving in there for fat content and the other two is just trace amounts from the other products we're using now you want to drop at even lower you could go ahead and opt for protein that has zero fat in it so you could keep that right around that 16 mark there might even be having some peanut powder mixing it up which I might try later on a different video but 80 grams of fat not bad at all guys can fit that right into your macros overall carbohydrate count 41 grams of carbs but what makes this especially cool is that 16 grams of that is fiber so a net 25 grams of our mod rates which is nothing in the grand scheme of things plus you're hitting your fiber goals for the day which hey everybody loves fiber right fiber is one of those things you don't realize how much you need it so you don't have it if you get on a bed you get what I'm saying and then protein we have a whopping 42 grams in this recipe so that guy's 42 grams of protein what any peanut butter jelly sandwich obviously a lot of that comes from our protein powder we get about 25 grams in that scoop of protein and then we're also getting some in the Greek yogurt and the peanut butter also has some protein in it the bread add a little bit of protein 2 PO 40 grams of protein and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich that's crazy so good stuff right there guys overall amazing recipe I recommend you try this and please don't get turned off by the peanut butter protein concoction I'm telling you once you mix it up you really cannot tell a difference and I tasted it by itself and I so thought it was really good so hey even if you don't make this sandwich you can make your own protein peanut butter at home now but I haven't spent all the money on it right once you protein a little bit of Greek yogurt you are in business baby and business so another great recipe guys that I'm going to employ in my diet arsenal hmm hmm okay we got one move we got off camera across from right here yeah Oh be my vignette stuck on the roof of my mouth
