[Music]
days in the last episode I met Emily and
I learned how her family became
fractured after she was drawn into the
gwena
organization how she went on Retreat
after
Retreat how it robbed Emily of her
day-to-day life and her grip on
reality how it nearly broke
her after hearing her story
the big question for me was how unusual
was her
experience were there others like
her I started to probe deeper to look
for others who had been to
Retreats among the blog posts and
YouTube videos of people saying how much
they recommend the Retreats I began to
find more and more accounts that said
the opposite
it the people I found weren't just in
the UK I talked to people from all over
the world Australia America Sweden
France New
Zealand there wasn't much in common
between these individuals some of them
came from wealthy backgrounds like Emily
and her twin sister some had nothing
some were well established in their
careers and some hadn't even gotten
their first job
yet
but what emerged was a
pattern where people from all walks of
life signed up to AO retreat in the hope
of
self-improvement to help relieve stress
or anxiety or simply to experience
something new to challenge
themselves instead they said their
brains were ripped
apart being in a retreat there's
something about the absolute silence you
know I felt very very anxious I I was
scared of what was happening I felt as
if I couldn't trust myself so I was like
kind of like toppled over on the floor
and crying and all these people just
walked by me and it was a horrible
experience I was extremely scared I've
never been so afraid in my life and like
literally felt like whole with my chest
just exploded and my body started
involuntarily shaking sometimes when you
meditate thoughts come up and it was
like this voice was like maybe you would
be better off
dead all in all I interviewed nearly two
dozen
people there was sky from Massachusetts
I think people would describe me as
someone who's kind of like daring and
probably strong Sky first heard about
gka Retreats while studying for a degree
in social work at the time she says
there was a lot of excitement about the
role of meditation in mental health
intervention and she herself was dealing
with mild anxiety and
depression some of it might have been
work related some of it might have been
related to Childhood and some of it just
kind of wired I was sort of looking
forward to where this would take me you
know with all the purported
benefits it was actually her doctor who
suggested she try meditating to help
with her symptoms he recommended she
applied to a nearby gka Center Sky
filled out the application form which
asked a few basic questions about her
physical and mental health but when she
found out she was accepted she was still
quite anxious about going I was kind of
terrified but he wouldn't be
recommending this if it wasn't really a
good fit for me and also just kind of
being an adventurous person that part of
me was really excited about
going
and then there was Nick from Alabama I
grew up in kind of like an industrial
suburb of Birmingham Alabama Nick said
he got into meditating in his 20s he
used to do about 40 minutes a day he
felt it helped him gain some clarity of
mind like just a little more crisp just
a little more calm I I think it was
helping to some degree with the anxious
patterns of my mind he signed up to his
first quer retreat in Jessup Georgia
there was Michael from Britain he signed
up to aena Center in herfordshire deep
in the British Countryside I felt like I
was emerging from an illusion not that I
was heading into a
hallucination and there were others
there was Neils from Denmark John from
Sydney Jenny from Southern
California there was something about the
self-denial and isolation of aena
retreat that appealed to all of them I
thought I was doing this really profound
and Deep thing and mystical experience
you
know all of them entered these Retreats
hoping this was going to be a positive
and maybe even transformative experience
but few of them had an understanding of
just what exactly they'd be doing it
felt
mysterious I think day one was kind of
okay it was sort of a exciting the
things that are really kind of stuck
into my mind were like turning over my
keys and my wallet and my phone you know
and and kind of like taking the plunge
into I don't know what I was getting
into they sat still for hours with gw's
voice surrounding them and as the hours
stacked up each of them did have
gratifying
moments I experienced a lot of peace and
Stillness in my mind
and feeling a connectivity with everyone
around me and just
Serenity I was feeling tremendously
energized it wasn't
relaxing it was like being wired so
you're filled with all these like
positive emotions you know I suddenly
felt an enormous wave of inner peace
total Peace of Mind total quiet total
relaxation total Bliss for about about
an hour on day
three but each in different ways and at
different times in their experience
started to feel
something
unsettling at first I just began to feel
afraid I just started to feel fear I
started to feel these waves of panic I
couldn't sit still I was in panic I was
freaking out and I was oh my God what's
happening they told me that the more
they meditated throughout the retreat
the more they had difficulty sleeping
and that cycle happened over and over
again and then sometimes that kind of
nodding off and then startling back
awake would shift into just feeling
absolutely terrified and that Terror
wasn't attached to anything it was kind
of
like like a nightmare or a bad
trip
they were all silently
suffering despite this the ganker
volunteers would press them all to
continue some of them sought advice from
the teacher at the end of the day and so
I told him you know like I'm I'm crying
I'm going through all these experiences
and his response to me was it's just
another
Sensation that was his response the
teacher just did not have the skills to
really receive what I was going through
literally everything I was saying she
just kept responding like just do the
technique and it wasn't just the
teachers at each Center who told them to
keep going G's teachings gave quite
clear guidance on seeing the 10 days
through this is a very serious job that
you're doing it is actually a deep
surgical operation of your own mind deep
surgical
operation
goenka talks about how doing vasana or
taking this course is kind of like doing
brain surgery and if you leave in the
middle of the course that you're kind of
like leaving when your skull is still
open was just stuck into my mind that if
I leave without
finishing whatever happens to me is
going to be more terrifying than if I
just you know stick it out the whole
process of cutting the wound and taking
the P out is
unpleasant you have to face it accept it
bravely and every unpleasant experience
that you have bear it
smilingly because it is for your
[Music]
good they all felt like they shouldn't
leave or in some cases perhaps they
couldn't leave and they began to have
severe breakdowns some more dire than
others I finally lost it completely they
got the assistant teacher and he came to
my room and um at that point I was sort
of believing 100% in my hallucination
and he he was half a reptile in his face
so one side of his face he was like a
lizard or something like that and at
this point I had no idea that I was
hallucinating or Dreaming or whatever
for me this was real this was my reality
there is this half lizard creature
sitting in my room trying to convince me
to come back to the meditation
hole my life shattered my life shattered
into a million
pieces I was
so dissociated at the time it was like
being stuck in like a bad psychedelic
trip that you can't get out of that just
keeps
going Sky nose dived after she finished
her first
Retreat yeah I got to the point you know
after about 50 days of not really
sleeping where I just couldn't go on
anymore I remember lying in bed I was
staying with my mom because I was
struggling so much and kind of having
this realization that you know
like maybe the only way to to kind of
get through this is to
die after realizing she had suicidal
ideation Sky asked her therapist to
refer her to a psychiatric unit I was
there for I think about seven
nights Michael didn't make it to the end
of his first Retreat on day eight he
ended up being removed from The Gua
Center in handcuffs by the police before
being taken to hospital when the
ambulance team arrived I wouldn't
cooperate with them I just said no I'm
not going with you and the only people
who can move you against your will are
the
police Michael remembers being under
police supervision at the hospital and
while he waited to see the on duty
psychiatrist
he says he was subsumed by a roing
primal fear that it was like he was
dying and being reborn every 90
seconds this went on for
hours I couldn't really
determine what was happening it was very
difficult for me to understand what was
real and what was
[Music]
not of all the people I interviewed a
few of them like sky and Michael had
experiences during or after an initial
gko
retreat but for most of these people it
was only after several Retreats that
something seemed to go
wrong and when it went wrong it went
really
wrong like with
Sarah
that's after the
break do you want something to eat it's
kind of lunchtime yeah cool we made some
really nice venic to you um have you my
God expecting might be like biscuit
please we' got of Ito I met Sarah in
Oxfordshire where she lived in a sweet
little house with a
roommate Sarah is Emily's identical twin
sister you met Emily in the last episode
you might recall the twins grew up
playing music together in a beautiful
house with Gardens in the English
Countryside Sarah seems a bit more
introverted than her twin sister but is
a kind and warm host we sat down to do
the interview in a music room next to
her
cello nowadays Sarah doesn't give off
party animal Vibes but she pulls out a
photo of herself at a house party during
her student years where she's covered in
body paint wearing a boob tube and
grinning at the camera she looks like
she's the life and
soul she tells stories about when she
was in college the old
her we used to have these big parties in
our house just like lots of fun themes
that's of dressing up oh so there was
one party which is like desert island
themed I went as Ariel from The
Tempest some friends we like we're only
going to speak
Shakespeare
Sarah had tons of fun at
University but she was feeling a little
lost after finishing her degree she was
also struggling to find a cure for
debilitating nerve pain in her
arms she thought meditation might help
and Emily her twin sister recommended
going to awko
retreat The Retreat Center in
herfordshire was peaceful and she was
pleased to be around a big group of
people her own
age as the course progressed she found
that amazing things started happening to
her
mind I find it quite incredible what
would happen if You observe like if you
stay that concentrated for a long time
kind of felt like my mind was becoming
very clear and very sharp and it felt
like I was going into a state of mind
that was quite above
ordinary the third day I started to like
see
patterns see patterns it was kind of
like with my eyes closed in my field of
vision there were just like all these
like geometric kind of patterns uh like
shapes and things moving and then when I
went
outside everything looked really
geometric everything was really really
colorful Sarah achieved what the
organization says is possible she was
able to reach a higher spiritual plane
one that led to quote increased
awareness non- delusion self-control and
peace
it's basically like a sober psychedelic
experience it's very very mentally
altering and it was as if I'd taken
psychedelic drugs for 10
days and something else amazing happened
to Sarah during the retreat her nerve
pain completely
disappeared so it did kind of feel like
a kind of cleanse that was benefiting my
body as well so that was kind of quite
amazing I was like oh wow you know I
seem to really be responding well to to
this this
practice by the fourth day Sarah felt
overwhelmed by emotion and broke down
sobbing I left the hall and I went into
outside and then the helper came and was
like you know are you okay and I was
just like it's just all a lot you know
and she was like oh no um but just you
know just go in and just carry on carry
on with meditation and
just just let the tears
fall when she came out of the other side
of the 10-day program Sarah felt like a
new person I felt like I kind of went to
a different planet I don't know if that
makes sense I kind of felt like I could
see through all the problems in the
world
and I just felt like my mind had been so
so transformed and I had like entered
into some completely new way of like
seeing the world
world but the fact she suddenly saw the
world differently meant she also viewed
her family in a new light back at
home things weren't the same around them
afterwards basically I felt like I
didn't trust my family
anymore I was almost kind of convinced
that they were like bad and that this
was the way to be good and and it kind
of made me feel like feeling very
euphoric but also
very at odds with everything in my
[Music]
life Sarah was job hunting while living
at home but she had also started
meditating for 3 hours a
day and soon enough Sarah signed up to
another retreat in France and then
another and then
another she became a server as well
working for weeks at a time as a
volunteer at the ganker treats once I
started the whole thing I felt like I
couldn't really function without it I
honestly just felt like I had to keep
doing it yeah um it almost sounds like
an addiction yeah it it is like an
addiction and and it's even more
confusing because they portray it as
like this ultimate antithesis to
addiction like they say that you're
becoming more
independent um and more self-sufficient
by practicing meditation but actually
the opposite is true and I think it's
like anything that's very mentally
altering it has the potential to become
addictive an addiction to
meditation that's what Sarah told me she
had after nearly 3 years of meditating
serving traveling and struggling to
sleep something in Sarah's mind finally
snapped
she hit rock
bottom this was the retreat that broke
her it was January
2021 it felt like um something in my
kind of psychological structure had been
really just broken and really
damaged for a lot of people meditating
for hours can bring old memories to the
surface some times those memories are
traumatic but for Sarah something else
was
happening I basically felt like I didn't
actually have any of my own trauma to
surface and it was kind of all this like
trauma was surfacing from I can only
think of it as like
from like other
lifetimes I felt like I was in a war
zone or I was like witnessing someone
being raped or I was like a a
perpetrator and I was like killing
people and and that was kind of what was
going on in my brain sounds horrible
yeah yeah it was really really
[Music]
horrible over the next 6 months Sarah
spiraled out of
control by the summer of 2021 she was in
full-blown
psychosis her memory of these weeks is
hazy because she was so far gone
here is what she does
remember basically I was like
hallucinating for like probably 3 weeks
straight and I was convinced that I was
like go to hell I'm going to go to these
places where all this like torture and I
was actually convinced at one point that
I was going to
die um and that I was going to go to a
place where these horrible things happen
like all the time um I was just
basically completely
[Music]
Kate Sarah's mom and Steven Sarah's dad
say Sarah was only sleeping for 2 hours
a
night by day she seemed to be living a
nightmare it was like a terrible repeat
from when Emily fell ill from too much
meditation only
worse here's Kate
it was
horrific she would be racked by these
terrible sobbing fits you know we'd try
and take her out for a walk to try and
relax her she was so keyed up and we
trying to walk around the fields with
her and she suddenly be
convulsed with crying and immobile we
could I couldn't move she's a big strong
girl she just stop and she'd
be like this
Kate began to fear that Sarah would take
her own life she hid all the medication
in the house and kept it under lock and
key Kate became Sarah's appointed
Guardian to manage doctor's appointments
and to ensure she couldn't stop pile
painkillers she and Steven stepped in
shifts to make sure one of them could
keep an eye on Sarah at all
times by this point
Emily had come home to try and help care
for
Sarah Emily was still meditating all the
time as well but seeing the distress her
twin sister was in was the final trigger
for
her she had begun to realize that the
meditation Retreats were not helping
either of
them that they were potentially the root
cause of their
pain Kate
Steven and Emily struggled to keep Zara
stable no other crisis
were where she'd be thrashing we were
sitting on the sofa over there you know
trying to hold her down why would you
need to hold her down we were just
afraid she was going to hurt herself or
hurt us she was murderous as well as um
suicidal you she'd pick up a knife I
remember her smashing a plate full of
food on the floor over there um and just
the threats you know I'm going to kill
myself I'm going to kill myself she kept
asking me to help her kill
herself and and I had to say no I can't
can't do
that Sarah's episodes got progressively
worse that
summer just like with
Emily Kate was constantly watching over
s era hoping she didn't hurt
herself there was one night that she
won't ever forget she was so sick and
you know her eyes were like
this and she was making awful awful
noises like growling
shrieking
whoops animal gutural
noises and just screams and and it was
like you know it it just felt like a
really bad 1970s BBC horror movie you
know in the
Asylum and and this was my beautiful
daughter in my house this was our family
it was just shocking deeply deeply
[Music]
shocking that night in desperation the
family called an
ambulance after a nightmarish few weeks
they finally got the help they
needed their local doctor put Sarah on a
combination of
medications that helped her to sleep
after years of sleep
deprivation slowly Sarah started to
reemerge from the fog of the previous 3
years in the daytime she watched trashy
TV
shows at night she slept for 12 hours
straight crucially she stopped
meditating but she seemed
damaged her cognitive function seemed
slower she struggled to do things that
had previously been easy like turning
pages of Music in time while her mom
played but slowly she seemed to improve
she started singing again with her twin
[Music]
sister more than two years later Kate
still worries desperately about Sarah's
mental
well-being sometimes she's fine
sometimes I see the girl I used to know
in her who had a lovely Christmas you
know she's came home she slept well it
was like old times we were all laughing
around together and playing
games it was
wonderful and then suddenly she crumbles
and she's this
little
vulnerable lost
person
[Music]
so now I was
convinced I'd talked to so many people
like Sarah and Emily who' had severe
mental health issues during or after
aeno
Retreat so many people who said intense
meditation had caused them serious
harm but why and how what was happening
to these people was there a clinical
reason people were coming out of these
Retreats so
broken were the people I interviewed
always prone to mental health
issues was meditation just the Catalyst
that Unleashed these
problems or did meditation cause
[Music]
them hi Willoughby how are you hi good I
tracked down Willoughby Brittain who is
widely considered one of the global
experts on meditation related
difficulties Willoughby is the founder
of a nonprofit organization linked to
Brown University that's been offering
support to people experiencing
meditation related challenges for over a
decade it's called cheatah house her
organization has around 150 appointments
every month to provide advice to people
in
crisis Willoughby really knows this
subject inside out
starting with her own personal
experience I got into it you know for
myself to manage my own stress anxiety
and
Trauma meditation helped Willoughby at
first and she became a kind of
meditation
evangelist but she began to experience
something that can happen to committed
meditators something called
dissociation things like having your
body dissolve not not feeling like you
exist feeling like you're floating or
like located somewhere else other than
behind your eyes having uh kind of
hyperempathy like you don't have a lot
of boundaries in terms of other people's
emotions after her own personal
experience with intense meditation
Willoughby decided study meditation and
what it does to
people willby told me me I should think
about meditation as a form of cortical
arousal something that stimulates the
brain almost like a drug so if you think
about other drugs that people take to
enhance their attention or their
alertness like coffee amphetamines
cocaine rellin those are all
stimulants and they have a sweet spot
that if you take them you know you have
better concentration you can Focus
you're more awake but if you take too
much then you start to have anxiety
panic and insomnia and probably in some
cases psychosis if you take enough this
sounds a lot like an
overdose obviously the dose is a big
deal so the higher the dose the more
likely you're going to see
[Music]
difficulties
from their research Willoughby and her
team have found that people respond to
meditation differently for example they
found that meditation can sometimes help
with sleep at first but when people
start meditating for more than 30
minutes a day it can have the opposite
effect and so it can be very confusing
for people especially when for a long
time meditation was relaxing or calming
or helped their minds um when they start
to develop anxiety they often start
meditating more in order to calm down
more and then of course it gets worse
and so they get more anxiety so they
meditate
more Willoughby is describing what Sarah
told me about essentially an addiction
cycle you begin meditating to help your
mental state and the process of
meditating allows you to feel as though
you are helping your mental wealth being
so you meditate more but the meditation
in part is what starts causing new
issues as the problem grows so does the
amount of
meditation it starts to
spiral The Cure becomes the
sickness Willoughby sees it all the
time most of the people that Willoughby
sees are having issues from intense
doses of
meditation but some people she says have
have a reaction from the smallest dose
of meditation we're also seeing problems
from people who are only doing daily
practice like at home less than an hour
a day so we also see that we also see
problems from app use she's talking
about apps like headspace and
calm so it's important to say that if
you're doing a low dose it doesn't mean
that that's 100%
safe
willoughby's research findings are not
universally popular in some corners of
the meditation Community she's
despised oh
yes I've received over a thousand emails
from people who have all sorts of things
to say about me about my research about
how I'm wrong how I'm terrible how I'm
evil I've been called a false profit
I've been threatened with
lawsuits yeah oh yeah I get it
all but Willoughby is not deterred she
believes in her research and she does
have a particular concern about
intensive meditation
Retreats especially those that don't
tailor their programs to suit individual
needs if you have a super high dose if
you have a lot of people and a few
teachers if you have a one-size fits-all
everybody's doing the same practice and
there's no way to modify it according
to each person then that's also a really
kind of a recipe for
disaster and then when people raise a
red flag and say they're encountering
difficulties while
meditating the kind of most common
response that most people will get from
a meditation teacher does not help which
is basically keep meditating
whatever happens keep meditating is
almost always the
answer speaking to Willoughby it becomes
clear that there is a problem
here and the lack of consensus around
this means there's also a lack of
support systems on many Retreats which
makes them particularly
dangerous it's so common that meditators
get blamed for their experience you know
it's never the practice it's always the
meditator it's they didn't do it right
they had a pre-existing condition they
weren't adequately prepared there's so
many ways that they get blamed by their
meditation teachers but also by their
doctors and their
[Music]
therapist what Willoughby was saying all
checked out with the personal
experiences I'd heard but I wanted to
sense check what she had told me with
other meditation experts to find out to
what extent her views were an outlier in
her field it turns out they aren't I
found many experts who corroborated her
findings about intense and prolonged
meditation
practices the experts I spoke to said
that meditation related challenges are
real serious ious and can happen to
anyone this seemed to be widely
accepted the experts said it didn't
matter whether or not you had a previous
experience of trauma or a mental health
condition or whether you are
experiencing a major life
event intensive meditation could unleash
dramatic problems in an
individual even those who believed they
were completely
stable without any prior warning that
this was
possible and those affected suffered
real harm as a
result so the next question was how far
does this harm
go and what's the ultimate consequence
if it's not
addressed
regardless of whether she had something
going on or not at the end of the day
nobody helped her so even if she had
mental illness and we didn't know and
she just you know it was never shared
with anyone nobody helped
her regardless of what was going
on that's next time on the
retreat
