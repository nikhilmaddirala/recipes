this series discusses suicide and mental
health please take care while listening
and seek support if you need
it in January of
2023 I was sitting at my desk at the
financial times when an email popped
into my inbox the subject line
immediately caught my eye it read
meditation Cults and mental
health
my name is Madison marriage and over a
year ago I took on a new role running a
special investigations unit for the
financial
times our goal is to expose abuse of
power institutional failings in any
field business education politics you
name
it our publication normally covers
Financial journalism so meditation Cults
are not the kind of thing I usually
write
about but there was something about the
author's tone that made me sit up and
pay
attention dear Madison he started media
coverage of meditation is almost
universally positive yet the strong
evidence that it can cause serious
mental health issues especially in the
young people who are drawn to it in a
search for some form of
spirituality my interest in this is due
to the terrifying Damage Done to the
lives of my twin daughters now age 27
over the last 5 years due to their
involvement with the viasa
organization they are now recovering but
still fragile nonetheless they would be
prepared to share their
stories happy to chat
whenever I knew next to nothing about
meditation and had never even heard the
word Vasa before I don't meditate I've
known people who meditate just as I'm
sure many people have but still that
would hardly qualify me as an expert
but Steven's email sounded articulate it
felt genuine I felt concern for his
daughters when I read
it I know lots of people who have
experienced mental health challenges
depression anxiety and addiction Are Not
Unusual among my
peers and many people I know are trying
alternative methods to feel
better so even though I didn't
understand exactly what step and his
daughters were going through their
claims seemed
relevant so I replied cautiously I asked
for more
information and then I began to research
the organization Steven referred to
something to do with the word
gka the focus of this group is a
specific type of meditation called
vipasa it offers 10day silent meditation
retreats to participants all over the
world you're going to hear those two
words pretty
interchangeably gka and
viass gka is the name of the man who
founded this network of Retreats a kind
of Guru at the heart of the network and
Vasa is the meditation technique he
adopted you hear G's voice at every
Retreat this technique will help
you to explode the truth of the entire
field of
metal Gwen's method involves
systematically scanning your body from
your head to your feet over and over
observing the sensations you come across
body sensation is so
important and as you proceed on the path
it will become clearer and
clearer as soon as I started researching
it I saw how popular gka Retreats are so
I just just recently came back from
theas Meditation Retreat 10 course where
you can't speak or make eye contact with
anyone Twitter founder Jack dorsy Raves
about gka Retreats thousands of people
go on them every year getting off the
wait list for one of these Retreats is a
bit like getting glastenbury tickets
people love them and they're fanatical
about their experiences
online guys it is all true what all
these people say about these theas and
courses I'd almost go as far as to say
it's almost the happiest I've ever been
in my entire life I would recommend a
retreat to anyone even if it's just to
see what you're made of Gua meditation
centers are everywhere from Scandinavia
to Latin America Central Europe to far
flung corners of Southeast Asia people
within the meditation world all seem to
have heard of
it it's
respected maybe even
revered
Gena's technique supposedly allows for
the quote total eradication of mental
impurities and the highest happiness of
full
Liberation when I scrolled down a bit
further on the results of my Google
search there were a handful of articles
that detailed personal experiences at
gko
Retreats some of them readed like horror
stories there's a rabbit Hall of Reddit
threads where people detail physical
pain and psychological
breaks people refer to the Retreats as
being like a voluntary prison sentence
and accused the teachers running them as
exhibiting irresponsible Behavior
bordering on
malpractice before long I was
corresponding with the author of the
email I had received a few days earlier
his name is
Steven he's the one who urged me to look
into this group in the first place from
the start he was not shy about voicing
his opinions on The Gua organization the
organization is based on a false premise
which is that
ultimately intensive meditation can help
people and maybe it does help some
people but it's like a very strong
drug and it has side
effects Steven was adamant that the
meditation group his daughters had
become involved with was
dangerous that it warranted scrutiny
from me and from the
authorities the gwena organization is
registered as a charity in many of the
countries it operates in and it's pulled
in substantial government
grants he felt the whole setup should be
questioned because we don't understand
the human mind people like this are are
selling what in my mind amounts to quack
cures to vulnerable young people
including my
daughters frankly initially I was
skeptical Steven said his twin daughters
had become a shell of the people they
once were that they were fragile that
they were in
recovery I kept thinking recovery from
what
exactly
How could a meditation organization that
promises spiritual Bliss end up causing
such in Steven's words terrifying
damage was he right did this
organization bear any resemblance to a
cult this was the starting point on a
12-month Journey attempting to
understand the world of one
organization a world that advertises
self-improvement and spiritual
Awakenings and allegedly has caused real
psychological and physical
harm it's a journey unlike any other
story I've worked on
before from the special investigations
team at the financial times this is the
retreat The Retreat The Retreat The
Retreat I went into what I would
consider a psychotic Drake it was like
being in a torture chamber for my mind
for six months the Retreat Retreat the
final goal is to purify the
Mind episode one dear
Madison Steven told me his twin
daughters had experienced serious mental
health episodes after getting drawn into
gko Retreats but I struggled to
understand why and how so I set off on
the train from Paddington in central
London to meet the
family
Hello nice to meet you as well how are
you I'm the twins don't want to be named
for many reasons so we're using pims
Sarah and
Emily Emily was the first of the and
sisters to discover guenka when I met
her she was lodging with her boyfriend
and a woman in her 50s who was a Vicor
at a nearby
Church Emily told me the Vicor had
agreed to take the couple in after
learning about her difficulties she
tried to live with roommates her own age
but she found it too difficult living in
a lively house chair with other
20-some her nervous system was different
now she said and extremely sensitive
different things but I have to be
careful now like I can't go up partying
like if I start to push myself too hard
I'll feel it immediately and then I have
to take I just like everything gets
fried and I just have to stop and I have
to like go in Garden for a couple of
days just to like feel okay again so
it's like I have to go very
easy Emily is tall and slim with kind
friendly eyes and a bookish look about
her she's outgoing and gregarious and
seems at ease with herself she comes
across as warm and generous so just tell
me a little bit about your childhood um
you know I was very lucky to grow up in
like a lot of material comfort and yeah
I went to really good schools and had
lots of opportunities with lots of music
like I wanted to know whether there were
any underlying issues in the family that
led to the twins spiral did they have
any conditions they could point to or
past trauma that might make them
particularly susceptible to severe
mental health problems yeah I like
definitely found teenagers pretty rough
like I was happy sometimes and sometimes
I felt lonely and
excluded but Emily said the house was
overall a happy one growing up that
outside of the usual squabbling between
the siblings or the occasional fallouts
with their parents they didn't have
significant
problems in fact there was kind of an
idilic quality to their lives as Emily
tells it they come from a very musical
family their mom is a music teacher and
pianist
their dad Steven works in finance but at
home he's also quite musical he started
playing the trumpet when he turned 50
and he sings we go out walking a lot
we'd always go to cello classes you have
cello classes um you we used to play and
like we always had nice Garden so we'd
always kind of
play the Twins and their brother were
each given a cello at the age of four
and weekends growing up they spent their
time playing in quartets as a family
singing together going for walks in the
countryside cooking we'd have dinner
together dad would always cook a Sunday
dinner roast and Mom and Dad were always
really like strong together and
definitely cared about us a
lot by the end of 2014 Emily's future
was looking bright she'd been a straight
A student in school but she still had
fun she worked a job on Saturdays and
went to parties on the weekend Fred
about her love life and went on holidays
with friends like I was pretty Work Hard
Play Hard like I would go out partying
until 4:00 in the morning and then get
up and do my weekend job and then go
back to school and do my a levels and
like but it was fun like I I kind of
thrived off that I
think when she was 18 Emily got a place
to study French and Spanish at Oxford
University she was really excited for
this chapter of her life to begin but
when she got to Oxford she found it
tough tougher than she had
expected I just really struggled through
it when other people didn't I felt like
I didn't have time to kind of breathe
and you know I felt like it was just too
much Emily decided to take a year out of
her studies just to catch a breath she
could go back to Oxford the following
year and in the meantime she'
travel just before she set off a friend
gave her a book on
mindfulness this book was the first time
she had come across the word V pasner
she found the meditation principles in
it exciting I remember reading and being
like this is what I've been looking for
cuz this is like all about finding peace
inside and like coming out of mental
complexes and like I was just really
like fascinated by the whole
thing as Emily backpacked with a group
of strangers she learned more about
meditation and a particular Retreat a
special 10-day silent meditation program
founded by the spirit spiritual leader
Satya narana guena in the
1970s Gua was a businessman from Burma
who got into meditation in his 30s to
help with intense migraines he really
took to the practice to the point where
he gave up his business to move to India
and teach meditation full-time let
people believe in this God or that God
or this philosophia that feel don't
quarrel but don't forget the
ense over time he began teaching this
method to individuals all over the world
he went on to establish a Global Network
of over 2040 vas
centers and an intense and rigid method
of his
own 10 days people are to spare which
looks too much oh 10 days how can I give
10 days but once you pass through it you
find these were the best days of my
life one of the most unusual things
about this
organization is that all of these
courses are completely
free this helps Drive their popularity
and the whole gka network depends on
donations and volunteer
work gwena passed away in 2013 but
recordings of his voice still boom
across Vasa meditation halls around the
world today and his meditation system a
rigid timetable that starts at 4:00 a.m.
and finishes is at 9:30 p.m. remains
identical in every country his
organization operates
in it's
hardcore some people call it the Marines
of
meditation Emily actually signed up to
aeno retreat while she was traveling in
India but she had second thoughts of
realizing the course structure sounded
pretty
intense I was like no that sounds a bit
put on I'll do that later on in life so
I went and did like other stuff and like
just had fun like I just traveled loads
and like had a traveling romance and you
know just like forgot about Oxford and
how stressful it
was but Emily did learn a lot about
meditating while she was traveling and
she started to meditate from time to
time after she returned to Oxford in
early
2016 that summer Emily signed up to her
first quker retreat at a center close to
her parents home in herfordshire this
time she felt ready she wanted to
continue to better herself to keep
finding ways to cope with stress I did
not think that it might be risky
absolutely no thought of that at
all the retreat center in herfordshire
is called dhad DEA and it's in an old
remote
Farmhouse the setting was tranquil but
isolated D is very lovely very pretty um
and I stayed in like an old farmhouse in
a shared room with one other lady which
was very simple I had that sense when I
arrived like oh this is such a nice like
lovely you know lovely
environment I felt like Associated
meditation Retreats like safety and
nourishment and like good food and like
lots of sleep lots of time to like feel
well but just wasn't really that
experience
Emily soon realized that the intensity
of this retreat was unlike anything she
had ever experienced on the first day
she was given a warning in the first
night they kind of tell you you should
surrender to the whole process they say
it's like an operation for your
mind to make your mind
healthy it's like a medical procedure
they told her and you mustn't leave in
the middle of it cuz if you leave in the
middle of it it's dangerous it's like
leaving during an
operation which is in the process of
happening when your cut
[Music]
open over the next 10 days silence would
be mandatory as she embarked on a
grueling meditation regime starting at
4:00 a.m. she had to meditate what felt
like all day every day and it physically
hurt and so it be fine for a bit cuz I
was used to doing like a bit of
meditation I found that caling but then
it was like just having to carry on I
was like oh my God
so Emily wasn't sure if she was supposed
to be feeling so
unpleasant she wanted to leave at one
point but the teachings during the
retreat encouraged her to keep going so
she did they say in the teachings like
your mind is full of impurities and like
you've become a slave to all your
impurities so now you need to learn to
control your mind there was kind of
sense of like I should do this I must do
this and I'm a bad person if I can't do
it Emily stayed through 10 days of
meditating for 10 hours a day in silence
and with no communication with the
outside
world the hardest thing for her was that
she stopped being able to sleep I
couldn't sleep at all from day one yeah
from day one
Emily says that she never had sleep
issues before this Retreat aside from a
couple of restless nights ahead of a big
exam I just thought it was my fault and
it was because of my my mind that I
wasn't able to
sleep some aspects of the retreat were
positive exciting even Emily began to
have almost transcendental
experiences there will be moments which
felt really good and felt like this is
what I've been looking for like feeling
a sense of connection to everything and
like it's reallying a state of mind that
was like very above for every day like
massive rushes of Serotonin would
definitely happen at certain
[Music]
points on the 10th day the meditators
could finally talk to each other and
compare experiences many seem to have
reached some kind of higher
plane supposedly if you've applied the
technique correctly you are meant to
feel a harmonious flow through your body
but Emily hadn't quite gotten there the
overachiever in her felt like she'd
missed the Mark I just felt like I
failed I felt like I hadn't got it right
or I hadn't there was something that I
hadn't experienced or like everyone was
talking about like this will happen that
will happen I was I can't even do it I
can't even I can't even feel my body
as a whole as everyone's saying that I
should
do she thought maybe she just wasn't
that good at this maybe she needed to
work
harder so I felt like okay I need to
come back and try again that was how I
felt cuz I felt like I just failed I
felt pretty cut
open more after the
[Laughter]
[Music]
break
Emily left the retreat feeling a little
downcast but determined to do another
ganker Retreat soon and get it
right she also had a slight
Buzz the trippier moments during the
retreat carried over and helped her feel
calm as she headed off to study overseas
the sleeplessness aside she felt it had
done her some
good while she was abroad Emily found
herself with time on her hands so she
signed up to work as a volunteer at a
ganker retreat even though she had only
been through a single Retreat she was
deemed qualified to work as a
volunteer volunteers at the Retreats are
called servers an unpaid position but
your board and lodging is free you do
less meditation around 4 hours a day and
otherwise help out around the venue
preparing meals cleaning toilets making
beds
and socializing with the other
servers Emily's serving experience
during the first retreat was
okay but then she signed up to be a
server for a second Retreat and that
retreat was different horribly
different it really started to me
up so I stopped sleeping started to have
major emotional like big big emotional
reactions to things and then I would
have like lucid dreams I was like I was
like a fish swimming through the ocean
and like like almost hallucinatory
dreams and stuff like that which I never
had
before but the whole narrative there was
like oh it's good you know that's what
we're here for we're here to like get
all of our stuff out of us so if you're
feeling anxious or upset or anguished or
whatever you know it's part of the
process Emily told me the retreat she
volunteered at did something to her mind
something she could not reverse
it set in process a chain of events that
completely overturned the next 5 years
of her
life her next few months were tough she
was supposed to be studying abroad but
she couldn't focus or think rationally
she moved several times eventually she
dropped the university course and
started hitchhiking on her travels
oblivious to any personal safety risks
she was meditating for several hours a
day this this is what The Gua course
recommended Emily should do after the
Retreats keep up the program keep
meditating Emily followed the
recommendations
diligently sometimes she sat with her
eyes closed on the side of the road
meditating while waiting for a
ride other times she meditated while
sitting in the back of a stranger's
car
my brain was like falling apart and I
wasn't sleeping I didn't know what the
hell was going on I was kind of like
slightly tripping the whole time in that
my state of consciousness was very like
being forcefully
elevated she finally returned to the UK
in mid
2017 a total
wreck when she came back she was clearly
very
unwell and she wasn't
sleeping this is Emily's Mom Kate
describing her daughter when she first
returned home she was stick
thin and she looked
Ashen I was
frightened tried to get her to see the
doctor and she
wouldn't she just
looked almost like an old woman you know
she'd lost all the bloom in her cheeks
she just looked
gray and not herself she just looked
like a bag of bones
I went to meet Emily's Mom Kate and her
dad Steven the one who sent me the email
at their home in herfordshire not long
after I met Emily Kate's a lovely lady
she came to pick me up from the train
station and drove me to their Farmhouse
which overlooks a field of sheep this is
the house Emily returned to from her
studies abroad Kate and Steven told me
how shocking her return was this is
Steven Emily's dad she didn't see seem
un happy she came across as not there
and obviously on one level she was there
physically and she could talk but it was
as if her personality had been
removed Emily says when she returned she
felt awful all the time every day so I
felt absolutely Dreadful I was still
kind of like tripping um I felt like I'd
just been split in
half she didn't know what was wrong with
her so she signed up to do another
Retreat the only thing that seemed to
provide her with any relief from what
she describes as a dreadful day-to-day
experience her parents at this point
were supportive of her going on the
Retreats and meditating at home Steven
thought that meditation was perhaps a
remedy for the insomnia and attachment
his daughter was displaying he thought
that I was just mentally ill and the
meditation would help which was my
general narrative as well but Emily says
she didn't have any mental health issues
before she started meditating
in Autumn 2017 a little over a year
since her first quker Retreat Emily
returned to Oxford to start what should
have been her final Academic Year but it
was
hell she became hyp sensitive to noise
sickened by food and suffered from
extreme sleeplessness and
irritability any sensory imput would be
like torturous like it was like being
tortured every day um and every night
nonstop I felt like I didn't even exist
anymore like I felt like there was just
no one it was like I was like an empty
[Music]
body somehow she got through the
academic term but by the time she came
home for Christmas she seemed to have
entered a psychotic
State she wasn't like a normal human
being she was like a
ghost she was
expressionless she had nothing to say
she did nothing except sit in her room
and meditate or go out wandering around
the fields at any time of day or
night face like a
thundercloud and then there were bouts
of
mania sometimes she would come and talk
to me and there'd be a strange look in
her eyes kind of mistiness and a kind of
far away look in her
eyes I remember saying to me
Mom I am the Messiah I'm going to save
the
world she said I'm Going Through The
Dark Night of the
soul and I said what's that and he said
don't you know what the Dark Night of
the soul is everyone goes through this
but I'm the Messiah and I'm going to say
save the
world after several weeks of watching
Emily get worse and worse she started
looking through Emily's Diaries that's
where she found some things Emily wrote
about taking her own life I found her
journal where she talks about
contemplating
suicide and she didn't see a doctor
throughout this period no she she
wouldn't and she was an adult and I
couldn't
her for Kate the change in her daughter
was difficult to
reconcile Emily had gone from being an
outgoing grade a student at one of the
best universities in the world to
dropping out of University and
withdrawing from
society she had become practically
unrecognizable since her first gueno
Retreat 18 months
earlier Kate knew she had to take action
by now she suspected that the meditation
might be doing her daughter harm rather
than
helping and she started digging around
on the internet for information about
the gka organization and V Passa
meditation she learned that there were
centers all over the world where 10-day
Retreats were held and that the Retreats
were all based on the teachings of this
one
man eventually she found blog posts
suggesting the whole gka network was
like a
cult and that it was pulling the wool
over people's eyes that what they were
offering was some sort of
bogus
pseudo religious experience but that
they were
essentially um
cultists this is when Kate started to
seriously panic she told Steven her
husband that she thought their daughter
might be in a meditation cult Kate
started reading books about cults and
how they
operate and giving to me and saying look
you got to read this and that actually
caused various forms of scales to fall
from my
eyes terrified Kate and Steven started
to look for ways to help get their
daughter away from this organization and
Kate came across a group called The Cult
information center and I phoned them up
and started describing to them what was
happening to my
daughter and they said this state of
psychosis can be brought on by
meditation and you need to get a very
specialist
help Kate didn't even know how to go
about finding a specialist for this sort
of thing it's like looking up a
Ghostbuster you don't even know you need
one until you
do the cult information center made some
recommendations and that's how she found
gry and
Baldwin yeah groups work to try and stop
people thinking for themselves and so
our job is to
rekindle those critical
abilities Graham's the director of
catalyst which is a charity that helps
families and individuals that have been
damaged by abusive relationships and
groups he remembers the call he got from
Kate she described the way her daughter
was behaving she was cutting herself off
sitting in the room all the time
uh unable to sleep having uh paranoid
episodes and you know the usual sort of
signs of a a psychiatric
breakdown Graham's worked with lots of
families who have made calls to him just
like this one families who think their
loved one has become involved in a
cult but Graham thought the important
issue was less about whether Emily was
involved in a cult and more about the
fact she was involved with such intense
tensive
meditation he told me about the first
time he heard of people having
difficulties for meditation it was back
in the '90s and he had been asked to go
to India to try and track someone down
who'd become involved in a cult there so
I decided to talk to people locally and
I I went to a local psychiatric hospital
the doctor said to me I'm glad you
called because the problem we have here
is something that we term the English
disease
and I said the English disease what's
the English disease and he he said it's
people that have uh psychiatric
breakdowns because they've got involved
with meditation groups in
India and so these people come over here
they get involved in a meditation group
they do excessive meditation and then
they have
breakdowns so when Graham heard about
Emily he wasn't surprised this wasn't
the first time he had been asked to help
someone who'd been intensely practicing
for Passa meditation and fallen into
difficulty and this is a problem with
some meditation groups you groups like
vasna presented that meditation is the
solution to everything you it will help
you to become a better person and etc
etc Graham says from his own personal
experience not everyone becomes a better
person from intensive
meditation about a third of the people
that do meditation it works and they
feel that it does make them feel better
about a third say it doesn't do any good
one way or the other and it's useless
and people stop doing it and another
third develop problems as a result of
the
meditation I was taken aback by what gr
was saying that effectively it was well
known that intensive meditation could
harm people and Graham says there's
often a reluctance for meditation groups
to accept the meditation is just not
good for some people even bad for them
like it was for
Emily now what's interesting about that
is that when the groups see this problem
of people having you know psychiatric
breakdowns they claim that it's just
sort of clearing out the rubbish in the
pipes you know it's it's something
people have to continue doing and get
over it and in my experience all ever
does is make the person
worse and the biggest thing in putting
them back together was getting them to
stop
meditating which was quite difficult
when they've been told it was the only
answer to their
[Music]
problems Graham told Kate and Steven
that it sounded like their daughter was
in a state of psychosis from too much
meditation they needed to get her to
stop meditating right away but this
would not be easy and they needed to
tread
lightly Kate created a plan to try to
convince Emily to get on a call with
graham I said somebody on the phone
wants to talk to you he's very
interested in your
experience with the Paso would you talk
to
him and amazingly she agreed
and so she spent I don't it was like 2
hours talking to him on the
phone and afterwards she was completely
exhausted and we went on like this for
four or five weeks planning phone calls
where she would talk to
him and by the end of about she must
have had five or six long sessions of
conversation with this
man she started doing things like
picking up the Sunday
papers commenting on an
article listening to something that was
said on the radio and responding to it
having a conversation with us she
started basically coming back into touch
with
reality and that was the beginning of
her
recovery Graham's and V vention seemed
to work but the progress gram made
didn't reverse things back to normal
Emily was still on a very different
trajectory to two years earlier she had
dropped out of Oxford was living at home
and still wasn't able to function in
society but at least she no longer
seemed suicidal or completely detached
from
reality Kate and Steven thought they
were beginning to get their daughter
back that things were about to improve
Pro but then something else
happened
unbelievably Emily's Twin Sister Sarah
started to get into meditation as
well ultimately becoming hooked on the
same form of Vasa meditation taught by
gka Sarah had seen her sister meditating
as a way to feel better so she thought
she'd try it
too I do feel a sense of of
responsibility and a great great deal of
guilt and shame and embarrassment and
like horror because of the way that I
encouraged her to go to do the past but
I also can see that I was only acting on
the information that I had available to
my conscious kind of self at that
[Music]
time Sarah went to her first Retreat
then another then
another soon Sarah started to exhibit
the same behavior as Emily had only more
severe she was being plagued by memories
of rape war and murder events that had
never happened to
her Kate now had two daughters in
serious psychological
distress and the common variable were
The Gua
[Music]
retreats
it was
horrific she was hallucinating some of
the time I remember her crying she's
going I'm losing her she's
[Music]
gone I needed to understand what
happened to
Sarah and whether these frightening
experiences were unique to the
Twins were there others who'd had this
experience too
just how widespread were these
issues that's in the next episode of The
