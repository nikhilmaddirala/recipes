* **ingredients:**
    * List each ingredient as a separate item.
    * Include quantities and units of measurement whenever possible. If unclear, provide your best estimate. Provide estimates in grams wherever possible.
* **instructions:** 
    * Break the instructions down into clear, numbered steps.
* **nutritional_info:**
    * Provide estimated values for calories, fat (in grams), protein (in grams), carbs (in grams), and fiber (in grams), and  number of servings. Please estimate a specific value for each field. Do not use "unknown", "blank", or any such non-numerical entry.
