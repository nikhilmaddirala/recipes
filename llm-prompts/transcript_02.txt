uh [Music] [Music] oreo mcflurries and mcchickens were something that i indulged in frequently as a child we have already covered the mcchicken on this channel so today in the anabolic laboratory we will be making an oreo mcflurry that is better than the one from mcdonald's i guaran damn tee it i will also show you the mcdonald's mcflurry right next to my mcflurry so you can see that making my mcflurry is a necessity my name is nick i have my master's in exercise physiology and i make anabolic recipes and i also review pretty much anything in the fitness industry do full days of eating etc so if you're into that kind of thing like this video and subscribe to the channel if you're ready to not only have your cream but your cookies too then let's get into it [Music] today we'll mark a new way in which we make creams since i've started using pe science as my protein powder i've always been getting a couple ice chunks in my ice creams i wanted to eliminate that and so i went on a mission and made attempt after attempt and today we are changing up how we do things we are going to start with 480 grams of ice in this blender we're gonna take this ice and we are going to crush it right out of the gate and we no longer will have to worry about ice chunks anymore and the consistency if you can even believe it is even better than it was before one minute on high and i will see you back all right now we're not going to touch the ice no blending no mixing it around so we're going to start with milk one percent milk why did i choose one percent i wanted to make a mcflurry i want it to be dairy-like like a mcflurry is fat equals flavor and fat will also make the consistency of the actual milkshake better and we're going to start with 130 grams per usual we will grab our fat-free greek yogurt and we are going to put in 120 grams our last and final wet ingredient is vanilla extract we're gonna go with 4.2 grams reminder if you don't have a point scale i have one it only costs about 20 anything that i use is in the description below however if you don't have one go ahead and use four or five grams that is fine as well at this point we will add our salt and we're gonna go with two grams oh and by the way if you try to crush 480 grams of ice in a non-ninja you probably are going to break your blender or it's not going to crush you almost need a ninja blender or a vitamix for this project i would go with a ninja i've gotten a great use out of the the 80 one that i had and now i just upgraded to the screen one the touchscreen one and it's worth it to me because it stops after a minute and all my blends are one minute long but we're gonna go with a minute and i will see you back such a beautiful thing i don't even have to think about it now we're going to take our blade blender blade out and we're going to mix this up it's going to seem very thin don't you worry but we're going to bring everything from the bottom to the top we really want to make sure there's no ice layer on the bottom so make sure you scrape really well at the bottom and we pop our blender blade right back in and now we have to go in this order don't ask me why i've tried it several ways but this is how we're going to do it we're going to go with seven grams of vanilla jello sugar-free then we're gonna go with a gram and a half of both xanthan and guar gum they mix together to make a very smooth creamy like consistency but if you only have one or the other use three grams of one the protein of choice is a whey casein blend it really doesn't matter what casein blend but for the best results and for the best taste i would go with the cookies and cream pe science whey casein blend 15 off when you use code e4 cm but i did try with a vanilla and you can get away with doing it with another way casein blend but i have found the best taste with this protein and luckily i'm on about 20 reps of this ice cream and that is when i found perfection speaking of reps do you want to get extra reps when you hit the gym gorilla mine has science-backed pre-workout products that will give you the motivation and focus to do just that use code e4 cm at checkout for 10 off your entire order back to the cream that being said this is almost gone i have about one serving left so we need to get 42 grams or about a scoop and a quarter yeah a scoop and a quarter or 42 grams of your whey casein blend the next absolutely crucial ingredient and i wouldn't recommend any other brand besides this coco trader brand because i tried three different black cocoas and this one is by far the best quality and the most realistic oreo tasting ice cream on the market again i will have this in the in the description you don't have to use this one but trust me i use three of them and this one was by far the best in terms of quality and taste now we're gonna go with 10 grams of this black cocoa powder and why black cocoa powder that is what oreo uses in their cookies like the actual cookie part of the oreo last but not least we have our swerve i like mine really sweet so i'm gonna go with 30 grams of swerve if you use a different sweetener watch out because they all have different sweetnesses but i recommend swerve because it has the least calories and to me tastes the most like the real thing aka sugar the last ingredient is the oreos this is where you get to choose your fate you want to put five oreos three to crush two to chop up and mix in and get the best taste but 55 more calories or do you want to save on calories only throw in three still tastes like oreo and it still tastes damn good but it's just not fantastic or the option that we're gonna choose four oreos three inside crushed up one we're gonna chop up and put on the top you get oreo in most bites and it tastes so damn good we're talking realistic as  like an oreo ice cream your friends no one else my roommate was literally like holy that tastes like an oreo mcflurry when i gave it to him before he even knew what it was if you want it the best way i would say at least four if not five but i'll leave that up to you so i'm gonna throw three of these in here and we are going to mix this up because i've been talking and this is just melting so i will see you back in another minute and we will do one more mix okay bye [Music] now we're gonna mix everything up top to bottom again we are going to take out our blade and we're already looking real nice and thick bring up ice cream against the walls of the blender so everything is wet and then with our spatula we're going to wipe everything down and get all of this stuff off the side so everything can really get mixed in here and also just like last time bring everything from the bottom to the top put our blade back in wipe down the walls one more time we're gonna blend on high for one more minute and in the meantime i'm going to chop this one oreo up really quick and i will see you back and we are going to eat six cups of oreo ice cream hell yeah we are going to go over the macros here in a minute but first i wanted to show you a comparison to the real thing now i have a regular mcflurry sitting right in front of me this is the largest one they have it is about 12 ounces or a cup and a half and we're going to pour so we have more left over in here which we'll get to in a second but we have a full cup of this i mean we're we're at least talking twice the size here and then we are sprinkling some oreos on top here just like this one right but we have bigger chunks we could do it our way bigger chunks always better and on top of it i have two small mcflurries which are eight ounces each okay so 12 ounce 16 ounces let's see i have filled up not only one that's at least twice the size i've also filled up two eight ounce mcflurries which is more than one of these 12 ounce mcflurries now consistency wise i'm gonna say it's about an eight out of ten a mcflurry is pretty thick and this was just in the fridge too so it's even a little bit thicker because it's been in the freezer this is the same thing here this is definitely a little bit thicker i'm not gonna say it's not but we're not talking about night and day we're talking 8 out of 10 versus 10 out of 10. but as far as actual oreo flavor goes when i try this the top tastes a little bit like oreo tastes like an oreo mcflurry but once you get down here and i posted this on my instagram too once you get down towards the bottom we're talking minimal if not no oreo with this especially if you put that extra oreo that's chopped up in here you're getting literal oreo in every bite with the cocoa powder with everything in here literally you are getting full on oreo flavor in every single bite so damn delicious mine tastes way more like oreo than an oreo mcflurry does and that is why in my opinion mine is better now is there more thickness and more sweetness than the regular mcflurry yes but mine overall with the amount of oreo chunks that you get oreo throughout the whole thing and not just the top because again the bottom of this is literally straight vanilla soft serve mine's better hands down now let's go over the macros for a 12 ounce oreo mcflurry from mcdonald's you're getting 510 calories 16 fat 80 carb 12 protein and 1 gram of fiber for mine you are getting 543 calories 15 grams of fat 89 carbs or 59 net carbs and 52 grams of protein along with seven grams of fiber because of the cocoa powder and the gums absolutely incredible and once you have it once you will not stop wanting to have it i'm kind of pissed that i have to move on to the next cream honestly i want to keep eating this cream however you guys voted i held a vote on my instagram you should definitely follow me on instagram if you're not already so you can be part of the viewer votes but i let you guys vote which blizzard you wanted for the fall flavors that just came out there were seven of them you guys overwhelmingly wanted a pecan pie blizzard so that is going to be the next blizzard buy the power 13 cookbook if you want to help support me buffalo ranch chicken sandwich pizza bread reese's protein ice cream milkshake so damn
